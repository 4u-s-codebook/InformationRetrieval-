Each command line argument in the query is either _AND, _OR, or a term.
Here a term is defined to be an alphanumeric string not containing
underscore. For this homework, two terms are the same if they are the
same after converting them to lower case. An example of running the
program might be:

python PositiveRank.py my_corpus.txt 5 "_OR _AND good dog _AND bad cat"

To compute VSM scores use all the terms from the query. I.e.,
for the above these would be good, dog,

bad, cat. The output
should be a line with DocId Score on it, followed by a sequence of
num_result lines with this information for the top num_results
many documents. For example,

DocId Score
7 .65
2 .51
3 .23
11 .0012

You should use the ADT from the book for inverted index retrieval
and implement your program using calls to the first, last, prev,
next, docRight, docLeft, etc methods. You should be using galloping
search for the implementation of the relevant methods.
