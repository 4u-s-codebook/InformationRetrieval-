Here aux_program is at most one of java, php, python (your choice). 

For php or python, PositiveRank should be either PositiveRank.php or PositiveRank.py, respectively.
If you choose to do this project in C or C++, aux_program is optional. Your program will be compiled on a Mac 
running MacOS Mojave, having used brew to install the compiler. filename is the name of some text document. 

This document is assumed to contain only ASCII characters with '\n' used for line endings. 
For this assignment, the sequence '\n\n' indicates a new "document" within this file. 
In the above, num_results indicates the top how many of the results satisfying the query should be returned. 
The query is a sequence of command line arguments in Polish notation. Each command line argument in the query is either _AND, _OR, or a term. 
Here a term is defined to be an alphanumeric string not containing underscore. 

For this homework, two terms are the same if they are the same after converting them to lower case. An example of running the program might be: 

To compute VSM scores use all the terms from the query. I.e., for the above these would be good, dog, bad, cat. 
The output should be a line with DocId Score on it, followed by a sequence of num_result lines with this 
information for the top num_results many documents. For example

Cases we have handled: 
1. One term that exists, multiple docs
2. One term that doesn't exist
3. 1 exists and 1 doesn't : AND, OR
4. One doc & 1 term
